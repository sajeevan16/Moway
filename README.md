### Introduction

The project is about designing and developing a virtual self-driving car using
reinforcement learning to mimic the behavior when it is running with a set of another
self-driving car or human cars. This can be used to observe the impact that the
self-driving car can have on damping the traffic bottlenecks caused by manned vehicles.
This framework can be simulatable in a different traffic situation and different
phenomena.


# User manuals

### Process Overview

The product can runnable using the executable file. First of all, decide the model name
and gave it into the Input box and select the Train Button if you want to train a model
otherwise you want to Play the model you can select the Play button. Next, you meet the
Environment creational user interface, Here you can create different traffic situation and
different phenomena Using Different maps, and cars and obstacles. Then you can
proceed with the simulation.

### Workflow

#### 1. Main Menu

Train - ​Gave the new model name and Press the Train Button in The Menu. You
will be taken to the Environment creational user interface
Play - ​Gave the already trained model name and Press the Play Button in The
Menu. You will be taken to the Environment creational user interface

#### 2. Environment Creator

First, User can Change The map using Right and Left Arrow Keys, And also user
can Change the adding obstacle or manned car using Up and Down Arrow Keys.
User can set the location of the obstacle by using mouse Click button and also set
the angle of obstacle by releasing the mouse button.

Right, Left Arrows     -     Change Environment Map
Up, Down Arrows     -     Change Obstacles / Cars
Z     -     Undo the Last Action
M     -     Exit To Main Menu
Enter     -     Enter to the Simulation (Train / Play)
User can Establish the Obstacle/Car in the correct position Using Mouse click
and Drag and Release the mouse click to the Facing Direction

#### 3. Simulation

When Training User can View The Epsilon Value, Max Distance, Last Distance,
Total Frames, fps Details in the Below. User can save the model(Reinforcement
Learning Car) by press the S key. You can exit to the Main Menu By Press M Key.
There is also autosave after ever 5000 frames trained.

S     -     Save The Model
M     -     Exit to Main Menu
